## Current Projects

### Zabbix Powershell API Wrapper

I am currently working on creating a wrapper for the Zabbix API in powershell.
The code is private at the moment, but once I have implemented some useful functionality, I will be relasing it on GitHub under the OpenBSD licence.
It is more of a learning project that anything, but hopefully others will find it useful for integrating Zabbix with their M$ Infrastructure.

### SaucyBot - Simple Discord Ticketing bot

SaucyBot is a bot I am writing to solve a whole in the Discord bot market for a very simple ticketing bot.
It is designed to be used by teams/clans/organizations who manage Game Server's as a centralised ticketing system for their community.
At the moment it is being backed by a database (MariaDB to begin with) but the plan is for version 0.2 to allow for flat-file esque storage of ticketing state to reduce the barrier of entry.
